### View: see demo.png

View is divided into different components. 
Look at design.jpg to understand better how the view has been organized.

Main Frame --> top Frame
               mid Frame

mid Frame --> Mid Frame Left
              Mid Frame Right

Mid Frame Left displays the flow of time.
Mid Frame Right display the flow of time through a time circle.
